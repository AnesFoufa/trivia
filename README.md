# A refactoring project
This project is an exercise to progressively refactor a legacy code base.
## Definition of refactoring
Refactoring is the act of changing a unit of code (class, function, module) in
order the to improve its developmental quality attributes (readability, modularity) while conserving its functional behavior.

## Refactoring the trivia project
The initial code can be found [here](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia/blob/master/python3/trivia.py)

The trivia project is an exercise of refactoring. This project aims to
progressively refactor the Game class. We will try to preserve the functional behavior of its public methods. The goal is not to fix bugs but to improve the readability and
the modularity even though typos will be fixed ;)
## How to follow the project
The evolution of the code can be followed on the main branch of git.

A journal is being maintained.

You can visit the [history](https://github.com/AnesFoufa/trivia/commits/main) and for each commit, read the new section of the journal describing the changelog.
